        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I tried to make a copycat Popeyes&reg; fried chicken sandwich and ended up with a hybrid between that and the one from Chick-fil-A&reg;. So you get the best of both worlds and what's more, this DIY version never runs out, not even on Sundays.</p>

            <li>canola oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>

    <div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to marinate for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together in a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Make the wash: Whisk egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dip into the breading to coat both sides; shake off any excess. Dip into egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat, shake off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from getting soggy.</li>
            <li>Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and chicken.</li>
        </ol>
